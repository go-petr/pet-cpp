### White belt
The first course is about getting to know the C++ programming language. It introduces: IO streams, conditional statements, loops, basic data types, functions, containers, variables' scopes, stucts, classes, constructors, operators' overloading, const keyword, and exceptions.

**The final project** requires the students to implement a simple database with the ability to add, delete, and search events.

### Yellow belt
This course covers C++ integer types, pairs and tuples, function templates, inheritance and polymorphism, iterators and standard algorithms, and the distribution of code across multiple files. Based on the current knowledge, the course demonstrates how to develop a basic unit test framework.

**The final project** requires the students to upgrade the database from the previous course by adding support for more complex queries.

### Red belt
In this course, students learn about writing more "efficient" C++ code as well as study the following topics: macros, class templates, bad code, using I/O streams, evaluation of the complexity of algorithms, C++ memory model, use of linear containers (vector, deque, list, string), move-semantics, introduction to multi-threaded programming
