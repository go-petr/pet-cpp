### White belt
The first course is about getting to know the basics of the C++ programming language. It introduces: IO streams, conditional statements, loops, basic data types, functions, containers, variables' scopes, structs, classes, constructors, operators' overloading, const keyword, and exceptions.

**THE FINAL PROJECT** requires the students to implement a simple database with the ability to add, delete, and search events.

### Yellow belt
This course covers C++ integer types, pairs, tuples, function templates, inheritance, polymorphism, iterators, some standard library algorithms, and separating codes in multiple files. Based on this knowledge, the course demonstrates how to develop a basic unit test framework that will be used hereafter.

**THE FINAL PROJECT** requires you to upgrade the database from the previous course by adding support for more complex queries.

### Red belt
In this course, students learn about how to write "more efficient" C++ code and study the following topics: macros, class templates, bad coding practices, using I/O streams, how to evaluate run-time complexity, the C++ memory model, efficient use of linear containers (vector, deque, list, string), move-semantics, introduction to multi-threaded programming
